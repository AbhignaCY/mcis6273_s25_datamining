My Zotero username is AbhignaCY.
This repo is created to work on datamining from basics. 
We are going to go through basics of github and its environment. 
Then going to get familiarized with jupyterlab environment, markdown and python.
We will also explore jupyterhub linux console.
Also perform basic data engineering in python using chocolate review data.
